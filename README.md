# Welcome to the Open Web for Learning & Teaching Expertise Hub, aka OWLTEH!

## What is OWLTEH?

OWLTEH is an initiative that aims to gather resources and examples of inspiring practice related to the Open Web and its use for educational purposes. It is the result of the generosity of educators and learners who want to share their knowledge and experience of the Open Web, enabling others to understand and take advantage of its potential for learning and teaching.

## Who are we?

OWLTEH has been initiated by a group of educators at **[Coventry University’s](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/)** **[Disruptive Media Learning Lab](http://dmll.org.uk/)** with the help of colleagues around the globe. The initial idea was refined and further developed through the 5th cohort of the **[Mozilla Open Leaders programme](https://twitter.com/MozOpenLeaders)**. You can read more about the process at **[blog.owlteh.org/](http://blog.owlteh.org/)**.

## How to get involved

OWLTEH aims to cover as many instances (applications, platforms, etc.) of the the Open Web as possible and to gather accounts of their use for teaching and learning within a highly diverse range of contexts.

OWLTEH consists of different types of contributions organised around three collections:

**Catalogue:** Instances of the Open Web: applications, platforms, techologies, or concepts

**Perspectives:** A series of videos contributed by educators and learners who are actively engaged in using the Open Web within their practice.

**Stories:** A selection of accounts narrating how specific instances of the Open Web can be used for teaching and learning.

You can contribute by sharing your own experiences and knowledge. Step-by-step information on how to do so can be found in our **[Contributing](https://github.com/drdvo/OWLTEH/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)** page.

As a contributor you will be able to decide the licence under which you want to release your content.

Participation is regulated by the **[Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)**.
