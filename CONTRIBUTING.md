# How can I get involved?

OWLTEH aims to cover as many instances (applications, platforms, etc.) of the the Open Web as possible and to gather accounts of their use for teaching and learning within a highly diverse range of contexts. Help us build a broad range of examples by contributing your knowledge to share your expertise with colleagues all around the world :earth_africa: :tada:

As a contributor you will be able to decide the licence under which you want to release your content, although we would like to encourage you to use one of the least restrictive options (preferably PD or CC-BY). Take a look at the different contribution types below. **We value all contributions, however big or small!**

OWLTEH consists of different types of contributions organised around three collections:

### Catalogue - **[catalogue.owlteh.org/](http://catalogue.owlteh.org/)**

This is a catalogue of instances of the Open Web covering applications and platforms that can be relevant for teaching and learning. It also includes resources and references that can help people understand what the Open Web is. Do you know any Open Web tools that you would like to share with colleagues around the world? **[Contribute via the Catalogue form here.](http://catalogue.owlteh.org/collect/)**

### Perspectives - **[perspectives.owlteh.org/](http://perspectives.owlteh.org/)**

This is a series of videos contributed by educators and learners who are actively engaged in using the Open Web within their practice. We have three questions to ask educators and learners who actively use the Open Web:

**(1) What is the Open Web? (i.e. the meaning to you)** - Let us know how you would define the Open Web in your context and what the phrase means to you. Sharing your understanding of the "Open Web" will help others to know what the phase means and different interpretations.

**(2) Why does the Open Web matter in education?** - Let us know why you think the Open Web is important for learning and teaching. Sharing your understanding will help others to build their knowledge of the importance of the Open Web for education.

**(3) Share an inspiring example of the Open Web in education** - Do you have an inspiring example of how the Open Web can be used in education or has empowered learners? Share your experience of the Open Web as a learner or educator.

Record a video or audio of yourself answering these three questions. Recordings can then be submitted through the Perspectives 'Share' form. **[Contribute via the Perspectives form here.](http://perspectives.owlteh.org/share/)**

### Stories - **[stories.owlteh.org/](http://stories.owlteh.org/)**

This is a collection of accounts narrating how specific instances of the Open Web can be used for teaching and learning in a more detailed way. While the Catalogue is for identifing instances of the Open Web, you can share here step-by-step information of how you have embeded some of those instances into your teaching-learning practice. In addition, this site contains a section for those willing to tell their story of how they first realised the potential of the Open Web for education. **[Contribute via the Stories form here.](http://stories.owlteh.org/desk/)**

## Adding extra information
You might also want to contribute with additional information complementing other contributions. For example, in the Catalogue you could use the commments to add references to specific projects that have been using a tool or platform for teaching and learning.

You might disagree with considering some of the tools or platforms as instances of the Open Web. You can also use the comments to express your opinion.

## Translating contributions to other languages
If you want to translate some contribution to another language, please do so and submit as a new contribution (adding 'translation' and the new language as tags). Please make sure the licence of the original contribution allows for derivative works.

## Participation guidelines

The following behaviours are expected of participants:
- Be Respectful
- Be Inclusive
- Understand Different Perspectives
- Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences

Participation is regulated by the **[Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)**.

## Why not collect contributions via GitHub?

As OWLTEH is a project built with the aim to promote the Open Web, we wanted to use the opportunity to profile the contributions made to the project through openly licensed applications and tools that could be particularly relevant to our target community: educators and learners in any disciplines. In addition to this, we wanted to keep hurdles to paritcipation as minimal as technically feasible (i.e. not requiring contributors to create any user accounts).

We have created a separate site for each of the three collections. These sites were built using **[WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress)** and are hosted by the **[Coventry.Domains initiative](http://coventry.domains/)**. Each of the three sites is an instance of a **SPLOT**, which are online publishing tools aimed at making it as easy as possible to post content to the open web. **[You can find out more about SPLOTs here](http://catalogue.owlteh.org/69/)**.
